this project is a small tech shop 🚀

_The site has a postgres database, I had a problem with my computer that did not allow me to use the MYSQL database but it is all the pertinent configuration to use the MYSQL database_

_These will allow you to get a copy of the working project on your local machine for development and testing ._

See Implementation to learn how to implement the project.
